                Storytelling

            </h1>

            <p class="info">

                Storytelling is the art of the media, where instead of aiming to display a beautiful piece, or a elusive melody, it aims to appease the masses by telling a story. 
                Telling a story has always been part of human nature, as we developed languages. The things we see, hear or think are all in part of the story in some sense. 
                A story is not a tale where it always tends to tell a moral, nor is it always bombastic, separated into genres of their kind. Stories are bottled experiences, whether they're fictional - made up - or very real, like today's issues.

            </p>

            <p class="info">

                All of Storytelling can be split up into multiple types, where its is not always pen, nor paper, that uses story telling. 
                Storytelling is diverse, able to blend in with other medias, such as visual storytelling, auditorial storytelling, or implicit storytelling.
                One technique that works for others, might not work for all medias. But what we can do is establish common tropes and reoccuring things that you may use as you perform storytelling.

            </p>

            <p class="info">

                Let's take down a walk through how this artform is formed.

                Whilst you can take oddball routes where custom routes are moved, or subverted to form non-standard crafts, there is a standard that most follow. 
                If fact, we have probably already used this method in our lives, that is the simple: Freytag's Pyramid.

            <p class="formationinfo">
                Freytag's Pyramid is an age-old paradigm, detailing the general structure of a story. 
                In it, it breaks down the story into segments, naming it specifically after each part.
                Let us go through a bit of it. With a little help from this video.

                    And then there was Rarity. The sight of her gorgeous mane and sparkling eyes nearly broke my concentration as she paused on her way to the general store to listen to me. “My, what a heavenly tune!” were her exact words. She dropped three whole bits into the jar, more than anypony else. I always feel bad when that happens, but a part of me thinks that Rarity needs to be generous more than other ponies need to experience her generosity.

                    So, I played my part, especially when she leaned forward with sympathetic eyes to say, “But dear, you look positively freezing! Tell me, are you ill?” It was true. My teeth were chattering, and—no—it wasn't an act. When the chills come, there's very little I can do to stop them.

            <h1 id="fourthtitle">How Words can change a setting</h1>

            <p id="thirdpara"> Words, just like emotions, are guided by their underlying feeling. 
                Usually conversations take the initial emotion of a scene, and carry it on with it.
                This can be seen with most media, as it is often to easiest way to either establish knowledge, build tension, or expectations.
                However, we will be talking about the except, mainly turn dialogue.

            </p>

            <p id="fourthpara">
                So what are turn dialogues? 
                Turn dialogues are dialogues introducing a twist in the middle of their sentence, in order add a little "oomph" to their speech.
                A practical example would be dialogue from Side Story: Path of Life from Arknights

                In this excerpt, Cassia is revealed to be part of an enemy faction, named the Seaborn. 
                Lucillia appears to uncover the fact, based on her dialogue and actions.
                This turns a regular dialogue to a turn dialogue, as there is suspense, and an inversion of expectations.
